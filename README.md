## 🚀 Vision & Overview

Welcome to my digital sanctuary. This portfolio is more than a showcase; it's a testament to the intersection of **art, code, and performance**. Designed to be a living artifact, it demonstrates the capabilities of the modern web when pushed to its limits.

Built on the bleeding edge (**Next.js 15+**, **React 19**), this project prioritizes a **spatial user experience** where every interaction feels physical and deliberate. We move beyond static pages into a fluid, immersive narrative.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

This project leverages a sophisticated stack to ensure robustness, scalability, and visual fidelity:

- **Core**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) & CSS Modules for granular control
- **Motion**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for orchestrating complex timeline animations
- **Spatial**: [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) & [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) for 3D environments
- **Infrastructure**: Self-hosted VPS (Nginx + PM2) with automated CI/CD pipelines

## ⚡ Performance First

Performance is a feature, not an afterthought.

- **Web Vitals**: optimized for 100/100 Lighthouse scores.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Critical path rendering with heavy components lazy-loaded.
- **Asset Optimization**: Next/Image for automated optimization and AVIF support.
- **Edge Caching**: Strategies implemented for static content delivery.

## 🎨 Key Features

- **Spatial Navigation**: A non-linear way to explore content using depth and motion.
- **Dynamic Hero Section**: Interactive 3D elements that respond to user presence.
- **Responsive Design**: Flawless experience across all viewports, preserving the core emotion of the design.
- **Contact Form**: Secure, integrated email functionality.
- **SEO Optimized**: Semantic HTML, meta tags, and structured data for maximum visibility.
